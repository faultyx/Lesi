# Lesi
❤️ Lesi the Simple Discord Bot.

## Setup
### Windows:
#### Needed:
GIT, NODE.JS

#### Instructions:
Download the bot as ZIP | Or clone with GIT "https://github.com/faultyx/Lesi.git" > git clone link

Open folder and open terminal, "shift + right click" you will either see Powershell or Command Prompt.
Making sure the terminal is on the path of the bot folder

Run "npm i" or "npm install" and let all packages download.

If for some reason this fails, you can do "right click on windows button at the left hand corner" then click on "Open Cmd as Admin"
then you must paste or type this in: "npm install --global windows-build-tools --vs2015"

Sit back and let it finish, more instructions available at: https://discord.gg/plexidev

After all those packages done downloading, you can open the keys and ids JSON files and edit them
iDs are for the specified channel which only need a id pasted in, eg: restarts
keys need your personal id, your bot token and your bot id etc

after all this done, you may open the terminal if you closed it, on the right folder path and run "node ." or "node index.js"

Enjoy!
